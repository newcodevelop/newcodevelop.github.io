👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Patna, specializing in Natural Language Processing and multimodal AI.

🔍 My research interests include causal interpretability in multimodal AI systems.

📜 I've contributed to several top-tier conferences and journals, including IJCAI, EMNLP, and IEEE TCSS, focusing on state-of-the-art methods in language and vision models and their interpretability.

## Selected Experience

### 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
I was a **Junior Research Fellow** at IIT Patna, where I've developed an advanced Sign Language Translation system and conducted impactful work on meme detection in multimodal contexts. I have also interned at **IBM Research**, where I enhanced large language models with function call graph (FCG) data, boosting cross-repository code completion.
